# Mandatory Post-Request Command Execution Rule

To ensure proper user feedback handling, the following rule **must be applied universally** across the application lifecycle.

## Always Execute After Each Request

After **every single request**, without exception, you **must** run the following command:

```bash
php artisan cursor:feedback
```

## This is **Not Optional**

- The command **must always be executed**, even if no feedback is expected.
- If the command returns **any feedback**, you must:
  1. **Follow the feedback immediately** â€” apply or respond accordingly.
  2. **Run the command again**.
  3. **Repeat this process until no feedback is returned**.

> Only when **no feedback is returned** may you consider the process complete or proceed to any other task.
